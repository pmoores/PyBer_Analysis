# Module 5 Challenge - Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Pyber Analysis
Decision-makers at Pyber require an analysis of ride-sharing data according to city type. A summary DataFrame and a multiple-line chart will be created to visualize this analysis.




## Pyber Analysis Results
The analysis revealed the following:
- Urban cities have the largest number of rides, total drivers and total fares. This is followed by suburban and rural city types, respectively (insert screen of summary DataFrame)
- Average fare per ride and average fare per driver were highest in rural areas, followed by suburban and urban, respectively.
- Total fares increase in late-February 2019 for all city types and then begin to lower again starting in April 2019 (insert screen of Pyber_fare_summary)


## Pyber Analysis Summary
Recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types:
1) Offer discount rate promotions to rural cities in Jan and Apr to decrease the difference in cost and hopefully increase ridership during slower periods.
2) Also offer discount rate promotions to urban and suburban cities in Jan and Apr to increase ridership during slower periods.
3)Offer a promotion in urban cities in March to maintain ridership and address the rise and fall in ridership during this month (rise-fall-rise-fall-rise).
